Our project involves the development of an E-mail phishing detection extension, designed to safeguard individuals from phishing scams. Utilizing machine learning techniques, our software will be able to identify potential phishing emails and will provide timely warnings to users. This approach aims to protect everyday users from falling victim to phishing attacks, enhancing overall email security and user safety.
